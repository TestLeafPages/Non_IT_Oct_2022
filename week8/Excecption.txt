Extent Report:
1.very rich looking report   
   -----Graphical representationof the summary
2.we can attach the screenshot of the fail/pass
3.we can have report based on categories like
smoke,functional,regression
4.we can have the report based on author
5.consolidated dashboard with pie chart
 
dependency

aventStack----version 3.1.5 free version

Integrate Extent Report
-----------------------
Steps:
1.Create startReport() with @BeforeSuite in ProjectSpecificMethod and keep all the common code
2.Make Extentreports as global variable
3.Create stopReport()@AfterSuite to have extent.flush()
4.Create testcaseDetail() with @beforeclass for test case details code
5.Declare ExtentTest globally
6.create Global varible testname,testDescription,testAuthor and test Category
7.Replace hard code values with respective variable name
8.Assign the value for the variable in the setup()in the testcase

Steps to attach Screenshot:
---------------------------
1.Create takeSnap() with selenium code to take the screenshort
2.Generate random number and append the filename with random number.
3.Have the return statement with random number
4.Call the takeSnap() from MediaEntiBuilder statement wtin the filename place to take the snapshort and get the random number
to append with filename

@BeforeSuite--to start the report
 @BeforeTest--to excel, Test name,des,aut,cate
  @BeforeClass---set value for the report
   @DataProvider
   @beforemethod
   @Test
     
     // take the screenshot
		File source = driver.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
		// Creating physical file
		File destination = new File("./snaps/screenshot.png");
		// Copy source to destination
		FileUtils.copyFile(source, destination);
