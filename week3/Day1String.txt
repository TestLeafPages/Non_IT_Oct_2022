char 'T''e''s'
Array
String -class
variable into string
//class  //variable//assign=
String name="Testleaf";<---literal
String name1="Testleaf";
String is immutable nature

Non literal
String str=new String("Hello");

String str1=new String("Testleaf")

To compare the string reference have to use ==

Classroom Assignment 1 A: Reverse the Name

Goal: To understand the String, loop

a) Create a class by name: ReverseString (with main method) in same package(week3.day1)
b) Write a logic to reverse a String
c) Run and Confirm the reversed String is printed in console

Hint: Convert the String to characters, get the characters in reverse order and 
print every character without white space.

Time to given: 10 - 15 minutes.
________


Classroom Assignment 2: Find the count of given character in a String

Goal: To understand the String, loop, if 

a) Create a class by name: FindCharCount (with main method) in same package
b) Write a logic to find the number of occurances of a given character
c) Run and Confirm the correct character count is printed in console

Hint: Convert the String to character array, loop and compare with the input character
if matches, keep adding the count. Finally, print the count.

Time to given: 10 - 15 minutes.

OOPs:
Object oriented programming language
1.flexibility
2.maintain 
3.reuse
Class-blue print methods data variable
object-instance of class
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance:
inherit the property (variable/method) from one class to another
1.Reusabilityof code
2.memory management
keyword-extends
Base/super/parent class
derived/subclass/child class
types:
single inheritance
Multilevel inheritance
Multiple inheritance-Not support in java but we can achieve by interface
